In my software development work I prioritize building efficient and cost-effective solutions.  I leverage modern technologies like React, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, SQL, and AWS, Digital Ocean or Heroku to achieve this goal.  For example, I designed a scalable real estate web application using a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails API backend, reducing development time and simplifying maintenance. 

My expertise in SQL optimization allowed me to significantly improve data retrieval speed in another project. Additionally, I developed a cost-effective SMS platform using the Twilio API for a real estate company, drastically reducing their communication expenses. 

I also built a web application with a cash register system for an auto wash service, providing them with real-time financial reporting and improved control over their finances. 

Generally I suggest to utilize cloud deployment on AWS (or other similar companies) for scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency in the projects
