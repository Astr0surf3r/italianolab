On this page, I showcase the projects I have completed both as a freelancer and as a programmer who simply enjoys writing code to create software. I like to build something from nothing and this also allows me to demonstrate my skills as a programmer.

## Hourtask
2024 - I usually write code to create simple software to demonstrate my abilities. I have carried out several personal projects, not all of which are public. Recently, I decided to make Hourtask, a time tracking software, public, and as soon as it was public, I decided to make it open source. You can fork it or download it and use it personally. Made with Ruby 3 and Rails 6 and uses Sqlite3 as a database. For any other information or clarification, do not hesitate to contact me. Ciao!
