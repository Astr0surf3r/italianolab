Welcome to Italiano Lab, my website! I'm a passionate full stack software developer and I have more than 10 years of experience in the IT field:

- [software development of web app from scratch](/back-end/) 
- [code maintenance and refactoring](/front-end/) 

## Development Tools

I rely on a set of tools for development to make coding easier and maintain good code quality:

- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: Travis CI
- **Collaboration**: SCRUM (Slack, Jira)
